# DDB Back End Developer Challenge
In this test we would like you to create an API that will manage a player characterâ€™s HP. Clients will need to be able to do the following:
- Deal damage of different types (bludgeoning, fire, etc)
- Heal
- Add temporary hit points

The Api should be built with ASP.net Core and run in docker. You can store the data however you'd like. You'll find the json that represents the character in  [briv.json](briv.json).
