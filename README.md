# DDB Back End Developer Challenge
In this test we would like you to create an API that will manage a player character’s HP. Clients will need to be able to do the following:
- Deal damage of different types (bludgeoning, fire, etc)
    - 10 points of bludgeoning damage
    - 5 points of piercing damage
    - 200 points of fire damage
- Heal
- Add temporary hit points

The Api should be built with ASP.net Core and run in docker. You can store the data however you'd like. You'll find the json that represents the character in this repo

_I’ll leave this part to you, Jason. I think we should include damage resistances, weaknesses, and immunities._
