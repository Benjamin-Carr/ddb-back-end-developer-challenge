# DDB Back End Developer Challenge
In this test we would like you to create an API that will manage a player character’s HP. Clients will need to be able to do the following:
- Deal damage of different types (bludgeoning, fire, etc)
    - 10 points of bludgeoning damage
    - 5 points of piercing damage
    - 200 points of fire damage
    - Heal
    - Add temporary hit points

The Api should be built with ASP.net Core and run in docker. A json object representing the character has been provided to you below:

_I’ll leave this part to you, Jason. I think we should include damage resistances, weaknesses, and immunities._
